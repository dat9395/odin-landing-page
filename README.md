Odin Landing Page Project

Available at https://dat9395.github.io/odin-landing-page/

Some notes: 
- I tried to use as much semantic html as possible (main with several sections, a header and footer)
- Roboto font: linked from Google Fonts with all available styles selected
- Page layout: using flexbox (as learned from previous lessons). I learned a lot about implementing flexbox after this project
